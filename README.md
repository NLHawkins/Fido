# Fido

### What is Fido?
Fido is a beer suggestion application built on the ASP.Net MVC Framework, utilizing the [BreweryDb.com](http://www.brewerydb.com/developers) API.

Fido matches a user with an available beer from a location based on a preferred beer chosen by the user in one of three ways:
1. From a user-managed list of favorite beers
2. From a list of nationally available popular beers
3. From an integrated search using [BreweryDb.com](brewerydb.com)

### Why Fido?

As microbreweries grow in popularity the average consumer finds them-self faced with a greater number of obscure beer choices at their local pub. Fido allows a user to choose a beer he or she knows they would enjoy and see matches based on specific attributes of that beer.

### How does it work?

Fido breaks a beer down into the attributes that lend to a beer's desirability. 
* Style (American Pale, Dry-Stout, Belgian White Ale etc.)
* Bitterness (**I**nternational **B**itterness **U**nits)
* Hops (The hops used to flavor the beer)
* Brewery (Many people like to support brewery from which they already like beers)

By weighting these similarities, Fido aggregates an ordered list of matching beers displaying them one side-by-side with the chosen beer for  quick user comparison. A simplified chart of the process is found below as well on the application's About page.

Fido was built as a capstone project representing a culmination of skills learned during my 12 week immersive course in back-end engineering at The Iron Yard, Greenville, SC.

***Fido is a work in progress as I will be adding features and refactoring code to make Fido more useful to both drinkers and bars.***
