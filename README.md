Project Name: PickMyBeer
Developer: Nathan Hawkins
Capstone Project Narrative

PickMyBeer is an application allowing a user to receive suggestions of available beers at a certain location.

Suggestion beers will be based on a “prefered known beer” (prefBeer) chosen by a user in one of these ways:

-User chooses prefBeer from a list of popular nationally available beers.
-User searches for a prefBeer by name or brewery from the BreweryDb API*.
-User chooses prefBeer from a list of previously favorited beers. (only available to logged in users)
-User chooses for the application to suggest random beer.

*BreweryDb Api - http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/

The application will then provides a list of suggested beers with details ranked by similarity in
-Style
-Bitterness
-Hops
-Alcohol Content
-Brewer
-Location

Logged in Users will be able to maintain a list of favorites.

Bar Users will be entered for demonstration purposes by the admin using publicly available tap lists.

Bar Users will have the ability to maintain both an up to date tap list and a previously poured list.

Future Goals
-Bar Menu Views, grouped by brewery or style, orderable by bitterness and alcohol
-Beer Log with notes/rankings/photos
